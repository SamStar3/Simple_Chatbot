LangChain is an open-source framework designed to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). 
It provides tools for chaining together multiple components, such as prompts, LLMs, APIs, and vector databases, 
to create advanced AI workflows.

LangGraph is an extension of LangChain that focuses on building agent-based systems using a graph structure. 
It allows developers to design AI workflows as graphs, where nodes represent steps or tools, and edges represent the flow of information.

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. 
It is often used to store and retrieve document embeddings for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines retrieval of external documents with a generative model. 
The retriever finds relevant documents, and the LLM uses them to provide more accurate answers.

Tavily is a tool that allows searching the internet for real-time information, which can be integrated into LangChain applications.
